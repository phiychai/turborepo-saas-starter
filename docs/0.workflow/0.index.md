This section covers development workflows, git strategies, and best practices for collaborative development.

## Overview

This project uses a structured git workflow to ensure:
- ✅ Safe and controlled deployments
- ✅ Collaborative development
- ✅ Code quality through reviews
- ✅ Automated testing and deployment
- ✅ Clear release management

### Git Flow Strategy

- **[Git Flow Guide](./1.git-flow.md)** - Complete guide to branching strategy, commit conventions, and pull request process

## Quick Reference

### Branch Types

| Branch | Purpose | Created From | Merged To |
|--------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| `main` | Production | - | - |
| `develop` | Integration | - | - |
| `feature/*` | New features | `develop` | `develop` |
| `hotfix/*` | Critical fixes | `main` | `main` + `develop` |
| `release/*` | Release prep | `develop` | `main` + `develop` |

### Common Commands

```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Update feature from develop
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop

# Create hotfix
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Create release
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
```

### Commit Convention

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Examples:
feat(web): add user dashboard
fix(backend): resolve auth token issue
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

## Workflow Summary

1. **Feature Development**: `feature/*` → `develop` → `main`
2. **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/*` → `main` + `develop`
3. **Releases**: `release/*` → `main` (tagged) + `develop`
4. **All merges**: Via Pull Requests with code review
5. **CI/CD**: Automatic on push/PR to `main` or `develop`
6. **Production**: Auto-deploys from `main` branch

## Best Practices

- ✅ Always create feature branches from `develop`
- ✅ Use descriptive branch and commit names
- ✅ Run tests before pushing (`pnpm lint && pnpm test`)
- ✅ Keep branches up to date with `develop`
- ✅ Use Pull Requests for all merges
- ✅ Delete merged branches
- ✅ Follow conventional commit format
